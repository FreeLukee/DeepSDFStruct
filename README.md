## üì¶ Installation

You can install `DeepSDFStruct` directly from GitHub using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mkofler96/DeepSDFStruct.git
```
To add it to your uv project run:
```
uv add git+https://github.com/mkofler96/DeepSDFStruct.git
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here's a simple example using a pretrained DeepSDF model, lattice structure generation, and deformation:

```python
from DeepSDFStruct.pretrained_models import get_model, PretrainedModels
from DeepSDFStruct.SDF import SDFfromDeepSDF
from DeepSDFStruct.lattice_structure import LatticeSDFStruct, constantLatvec
import splinepy
import torch

# Load a pretrained DeepSDF model
model = get_model(PretrainedModels.RoundCross)
sdf = SDFfromDeepSDF(model)

# Set the latent vector and visualize a slice of the SDF
sdf.set_latent_vec(torch.tensor([0.3]))
sdf.plot_slice()

# Define a spline-based deformation field
deformation_spline = splinepy.helpme.create.box(2, 1, 1)

# Create the lattice structure with deformation and microtile
lattice_struct = LatticeSDFStruct(
    tiling=(6, 3, 1),
    deformation_spline=deformation_spline,
    microtile=sdf,
    parametrization_spline=constantLatvec([0.5]),
)

# Visualize a slice of the final lattice structure
lattice_struct.plot_slice(origin=(0, 0, 0.5))
```

---

Since all SDFs are callable, the signed distance can be obtained by calling e.g.
```
lattice_struct(torch.tensor([[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]], dtype=torch.float32))
```
## Training a Model
A model can be trained by using the `train_deep_sdf` function that takes as input the experiment directory and the data directory.
```
from DeepSDFStruct.deep_sdf.train_deep_sdf import train_deep_sdf
train_deep_sdf("DeepSDFStruct/trained_models/test_experiment", data_dir)
```
Example data can be downloaded from huggingface
```
from DeepSDFStruct.deep_sdf.train_deep_sdf import train_deep_sdf
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
data_dir = snapshot_download(
    "mkofler/lattice_structure_unit_cells", repo_type="dataset"
)
train_deep_sdf("DeepSDFStruct/trained_models/test_experiment", data_dir)
```
Note that this data contains the preprocessed and sampled data. 
The data that is used for training a DeepSDF model needs to be in the form of `.npz` files that contain the negative and positive points as an [x,y,z] array.
This can be achieved by using numpy's export function:
```python
np.savez(file_name, neg=neg_points, pos=pos_points)
```
## Generation of Training Data
The generation of training data still needs to be included in the code. Meanwhile a preliminary script can be found under `work_in_progress/SDF_folder/sdf_sampler.py`
